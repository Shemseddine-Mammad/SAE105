User Manual: Network Traffic Analysis Tool
Overview
This Python script analyzes network traffic captured in .txt files generated by tools like tcpdump. It detects anomalies, generates statistical reports, and visualizes protocol distribution through charts. The results are outputted in HTML and CSV formats for detailed analysis.
________________________________________
Prerequisites
1.	Python Libraries: Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
o	pandas
o	re
o	datetime
o	matplotlib
o	base64
o	io
o	webbrowser
o	os
o	collections
o	csv
Install missing libraries with : pip install <library-name>.
2.	Input File: The input file should be a .txt file containing network traffic logs (e.g., captured via tcpdump).

Script Functionalities
1. Analyzing Network Traffic (analyze_tcpdump)
•	Input: File path of a .txt file.
•	Output: 
o	Statistical summary of network activity.
o	Identified anomalies in traffic.
•	Key Features: 
o	Detects suspicious packets (e.g., TCP flags like [S], [SF]).
o	Analyzes IP addresses, protocols, and packet information.
o	Calculates traffic spikes and flags IPs with abnormal behavior.
2. Visualization of Protocol Distribution (generate_protocol_chart)
•	Creates a pie chart of the 10 most-used protocols.
•	Encodes the chart as a Base64 image for HTML embedding.
3. Report Generation:
•	CSV Report (generate_csv_report): 
o	Summarizes network statistics, anomalies, and protocol distribution in a .csv file.
•	HTML Report (generate_html_report): 
o	Provides a detailed, styled HTML report, including: 
	An overview of network statistics.
	A pie chart of protocol distribution.
	A table of detected anomalies.
4. Interactive HTML Visualization
•	Automatically opens the generated HTML report in the default web browser.

How to Use
Step 1: Prepare the Input File
•	Ensure the .txt file containing network traffic logs is in the same directory as the script or provide its full path.
Step 2: Run the Script
•	Execute the script by running: 
•	python projet_final.py
Step 3: View the Reports
•	The script will: 
o	Analyze the input file.
o	Generate a CSV report (rapport_analyse.csv).
o	Open the HTML report (rapport_projet_final.html) automatically in your browser.
________________________________________
Configuration
Default Input File
•	The script uses fichier182.txt as the default input file. To analyze a different file: 
1.	Replace file_path = 'fichier182.txt' in the main() function with your file's path.
2.	Save the changes and re-run the script.
Output Files
•	CSV: rapport_analyse.csv
•	HTML: rapport_projet_final.html
________________________________________
Error Handling
If the script encounters issues (e.g., file not found, malformed input), it will output an error message and terminate.
________________________________________
Customization
You can adapt the script to:
•	Use other data sources.
•	Extend anomaly detection rules by modifying the detect_anomalies function.
•	Adjust thresholds for traffic spikes in the analyze_tcpdump function.
